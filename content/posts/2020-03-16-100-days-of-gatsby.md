After months of learning, I finally decided to use [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) to make my website instead of [NuxtJS](https://nuxtjs.org/). For now, I like [React](https://reactjs.org/) more than [Vue](https://vuejs.org/). I think maybe because I'm such a beginner of modern web development and React's docs are more friendly for beginner than Vue's (on my perspective).

And Gatsby is a powerful framework for React. I'm using it to make a film review website for my own brand '添糖电影院' on WeChat for weeks. The more I learn, the much I like it.

To improve the understanding of Gatsby, I'd love to join the [#100DaysOfGatsby coding challenge](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/blog/100days). And today is the results for:

- **Challenge 1**: Greate a Gatsby blog from scratch. I'm using the [UIkit](https://getuikit.com) for CSS.
- **Challenge 2**: Host my Gatsby site for free.

I'll use this blog to track my coding progress.
